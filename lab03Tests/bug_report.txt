Summary of bug: The function messageIsValid returns true when it receives an input of
                7 characters with no hyphens when motorcycle is false

Expected behaviour: 7 characters with no hyphens when motorcycle is false should return false

Actual behaviour: 7 characters with no hyphens when motorcycle is false should returns true

Steps to Reproduce: pass input with exactly 7 characters, no hyphens and motorcycle set to false

Severity: Pretty severe as it'll allow invalid license plates to be made. Easy fix though
